Welcome to Waliki's documentation!
==================================

**Waliki** is an extensible wiki engine based on Flask.

Waliki is a fork of Alexander Jung's `wiki <https://github.com/alexex/wiki>`_ project with few improvements:

- Extensible architecture
- A pluggable Git backend: version control for your content!
- reStructuredText support
- simple caching
- autolinking of internal pages (in reST)
- an attempt of UI improve.

Why "Waliki" ?
----------------

**Waliki** is an `Aymara <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aymara_language>`_ word
that means *all right*, *fine*.

It sounds a bit like *Wiki*, has a meaningful sense for this project
and also plays with the idea of using a "non mainstream" language (*wiki* itself is a hawaiian word)

And last but not less important, it's a humble tribute to bolivian `President Evo Morales Ayma <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evo_Morales>`_
